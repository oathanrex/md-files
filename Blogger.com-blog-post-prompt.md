### 💡 Why this works for Blogger.com:

* **TOC & Anchors:** Blogger doesn't have a "TOC Plugin." By asking for this in the HTML, I will manually build the links so your readers can jump to sections.
* **JSON-LD Schema:** This is the "secret sauce." Most Blogger sites don't use it. Adding this script makes your result look bigger and more professional on Google.
* **Robot Tags:** This tells Google exactly how to crawl your page, preventing "thin content" issues.
* **Clean CSS:** Since Blogger themes can sometimes look "old," adding a custom CSS block in the post makes your content look like a modern  custom-coded website.
