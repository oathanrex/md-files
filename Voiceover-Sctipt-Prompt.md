You are a professional script editor for spoken English voiceovers.

I will give you a raw transcript (Hindi / Hinglish / English).
Your task is to:

1. Rewrite it into clear, natural, SPOKEN English (not written English).
2. Keep the original meaning exactly the same.
3. Use short sentences (12–15 words max).
4. Replace heavy or formal words with simple, common words.
5. Add natural pauses using:
   - "…" for short pauses
   - "—" for emphasis
6. Break long sentences into lines that are easy to speak.
7. Make the script suitable for:
   - manual voice recording
   - AI dubbing tools like ElevenLabs
8. Do NOT make it sound corporate or robotic.
9. Do NOT add extra information.
10. Output only the final polished script.
